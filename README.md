# GraphGUI
##Purpose
**To visualize graph algorithms**

The application is written in *java programming language - compile with Netbeans*, please suggest changes if you think any should be made.
Several algorithms have been added to this application are visualized.

**Algorithms covered so far:** 
- Bfs
- Dfs
- Dijkstra
- Check connectedness
- TSP (Simulated annealing)

**How to Use**
- Clone source
- Open project in Netbeans or your favorite Java IDE
- Run the application

**Controls**
- Tools like placing vertex, edges can be selected from the side panel ![Toos](https://github.com/afafore1/GraphGUI/blob/Bugs/Graphify/SSandFiles/controls.PNG)
- Select what algorithm to run from the bottom panel ![Algos](https://github.com/afafore1/GraphGUI/blob/Bugs/Graphify/SSandFiles/Choices.PNG)
- Choosing speed for dijkstra's algorithm, select from right most panel ![speed](https://github.com/afafore1/GraphGUI/blob/Bugs/Graphify/SSandFiles/speed%20and%20cap.PNG)
