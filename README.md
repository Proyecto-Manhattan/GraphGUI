# GraphGUI
##Purpose
**To implement several graph algorithms with the use of visualization**

App is written in *java programming language* and source code available for anyone to look at and make contributions.
We are working on running several algorithms and making an efficient way to visualize how they work.

**Algorithms covered so far:** 
- Bfs
- Dfs

**How to Use**
- Clone source (Note: you can only compile with Netbeans)
- Open project in Netbeans
- Run the application

**Controls**
- Left click to place vertices
- Drag mouse to place edges between vertices
- Right click to remove vertex
- Middle click to move vertex around
